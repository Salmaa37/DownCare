How common is Down syndrome in children?
Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition
It's also the leading worldwide cause of intellectual and developmental delays in children.
In the United States, approximately 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome every year.
If your baby has received a Down syndrome diagnosis, you aren't alone.
There are many national and community resources you can turn to for support.
*Is Down syndrome genetic?
Yes, Down syndrome is a genetic disorder.
Abnormal cell division leads to an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.
The extra genetic material can cause various medical and developmental issues.
*Is Down syndrome inherited?
In most cases, Down syndrome is not an inherited condition.
It develops because of an error during fetal cell division.
But, it is possible for a child to inherit translocation Down syndrome.
This occurs when a parent's chromosomes have rearranged genetic material.
*What is the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome?
Down syndrome can occur regardless of age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
The risk of Down syndrome increases as the motherâ€™s age at the time of pregnancy increases.
Women 35 years or older are at higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Risk also increases if:
One parent is a carrier of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome.
A parent already has one child with Down syndrome.
Meeting with a genetic counselor is the best way for parents to assess risk factors.
